# Species

[opening statement and introduction to species goes here]

##  Traits

The description of each species includes traits; the characteristics and qualities that are common to members of each species. The following entries appear among the traits of most species.

### Ability Score Increase

Every species increases one or more of a character's ability scores.

### Age

The age entry notes the age when a member of the species is considered an adult, as well as the species' expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.

### Alignment

Most species have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your character is chaotic, for example, in defiance of a lawful society can help you better define your character.

### Size

Characters of most species are Medium, a size category including species that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few species are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding oversized weapons.

### Speed

Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling and fighting.

### Languages

By virtue of your species, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.

### Cultures

[culture definition goes here]

Some species are more common in certain cultures. Members of a culture have additional qualities due to exposure to certain enviroments and customs. Relationships within cultures vary significantly from culture to culture and world to world.

### Human Traits

It's hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits.

***Ability Score Increase***. Two different ability scores of your choice increase by 1.

***Age***. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment***. Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.

***Size***. Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed***. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Skill Proficiency***. You gain proficiency in one skill of you choice.

***Initial Feat***. You gain one feat of your choice. If you choose, or if your campaign does not utilize optional feat rules, then in place of the initial feat an ability score increases by 2, and you gain a second skill proficiency of your choice. The ability score increase must be different than the two abilites chosen above.

***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects.
