# Modern5E

Modern5E is the d Ruleset

D20 Modern tabletop roleplaying game updated for the D&Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules utilizing the Open Game License (OGL) v.1.0a by [Wizards of the Coast](https://company.wizards.com); see [legal.md](https://github.com/Juxtagames/Modern5E/blob/masterin/legal.md) document in the above directory for license information.

In more detail, *Modern5E* will utilize material from both the [dD20 Modern SRD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D20_Modern) v1.0 and the newly [REmastered Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition SRD](https://ogl-srd5.com) - based upon the official SRD v5.1 by [Wizards](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd) -v5.1 to create a uniquely updated modern version of the 5E rules.

**There are two versions of the Modern5E rules available to the public.**

* **The Modern5E Ruleset** is maintained in separate sections, chapters, and pages to use in your projects and publications via the OGL. This Ruleset is available here as a FREE download. There is no premium compiled version of the Ruleset to use at the game-table, though individuals are welcome to assemble their own tabletop edition from the available OGL materials. All pages are in Markdown (.md) format for ease of conversion; see below for more information on the Markdown format.
* **The Modern5E Core Rulebook** is a commercially printed product available in softcover, hardcover, and a deluxe edition. The Core Rulebook is also available as a compiled PDF. The Core Rulebook is a premium product specifically designed for use at the tabletop or online game sessions. As such, the Core Rulebook contains additional material, gameplay examples, and artwork, all geared towards understanding, learning, and enhancing the actual gameplay. The physical and PDF editions of the Core Rulebook are available at [Juxtagames](https://www.juxtagames.com).

# Work in Progress

The *Work in Progress (WIP) files are in the WIP Branch under the [pages* or [WIP](https://github.com/Juxtagames/Modern5E/tree/work-in-progress/pagesmain/WIP) directory, which contains all the project files currently under development, either as errata or clarification updates, optional or supplemental rules, playtesting, or for future editionsand for these reasons, all WIP files are written in *Markdown* format (.MD).

### Why Markdown Format?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language inwith plain text formatting syntax created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/). By its very nature, Markdown (.md) is a plain text format and will open in any word processor. However, Markdown contains specific syntax built into the text, which allows a Markdown Editor to compile the document into Richtext. Also, Markdown Editors can easily export Markdown into a multitude of formats, like HTML and nearly any publishing extension from Microsoft Word to Adobe InDesign and everything in betweenit can easily convert to HTML and many other formats using any number of various Markdown editors and translators. Markdown is often used to format readme files and wikis and, write books, blogs, and messages. Over the years, Markdown has become more and more versatile, and therefore more popular. The majority of new writers today are now using Markdown over other formats. 

However, the most significant factor in favor of using Markdown is that you are not relying on any proprietary format belonging to any corporation. Plus, because Markdown is a simple text file, the longevity of the document's structure is basically infinite.

### Markdown Editors

As mentioned, Markdown (.md) files can be open in any text editor, or create rich text using any plain text or Markdown editor.

Markdown files open in any markdown editor and may then be exported to nearly any popular publishing format desired. However, Microsoft Word and otheror any plain text applications do not process the Markdown Syntax. As such, there will be more work involved to utilize the material and remove or convert the syntax to a usable Richtext format. There are numerous Markdown Editors available, many for free. To convert Markdown to another format, we suggest using [PanWriter](https://panwriter.com) in conjunction with Pandoc; it is the easiest and best way to convert Markdown files, and it is available for FREE! can also open markdown (.MD) files, though the markdown syntax is visible, as such there will be much more work involved to utilize the material.
