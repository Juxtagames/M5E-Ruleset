# Modern5E

A modern adaption of the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules under the Open Game License (OGL) v.1.0a by [Wizards of the Coast](https://company.wizards.com); see [legal.md](https://github.com/Juxtagames/Modern5E/blob/masterin/legal.md) for license information.

In detail, Modern5E will utilize material from both the [d20 Modern SRD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D20_Modern) v1.0, and the newly [REmastered Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition SRD](https://ogl-srd5.com) - based upon the official SRD v5.1 by [Wizards](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd) - to create a unique modern version of 5th Edition.

## Ruleset vs. Core Rulebook

* **The Modern5E Ruleset** is maintained in separate sections, chapters, and pages for anyone to use in projects and publications via the OGL. The Ruleset is available as a FREE download (see 'Master Downloads' below). The Ruleset does not contain all the written material found in the commercially licensed products, and there is no compiled version of the Ruleset to use at the game-table. However, individuals are welcome to assemble their own tabletop editions from the available OGL material. All pages are formatted in Markdown (.MD) for ease of use and conversion.
* **The Modern5E Core Rulebook** is a commercially licensed product available in various print and digital editions. The Core Rulebook contains additional material not found in the Ruleset, such as expanded character features, equipment options, examples of gameplay, and artwork. This extra material is designed to enhance the gaming experience, both at the table and online. The physical and digital editions of the Core Rulebook are available at [Juxtagames](https://www.juxtagames.com).

### Why Markdown?

Markdown (.MD) is a lightweight markup language created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/). At its core, Markdown is a plain text file which contains specific syntax that allows a Markdown editor to compile the document into Richtext. The most significant factor in favor of using Markdown is zero reliance on proprietary formats, and because Markdown is a simple text file, the longevity of the document's structure is significant.

Due to its simple format, any word processor can open Markdown files, but not using an editor built to handle Markdown will constitute more work to remove or convert the syntax to Richtext. Also, a good Markdown editor can export to a multitude of formats, like .HTML or .DOCX, or nearly any other publishing format. Markdown is often used to create readme files, wikis, books, blogs, and messages.

There are numerous Markdown Editors available, many for free. We suggest using [PanWriter](https://panwriter.com) which utilizes Pandoc; it is the easiest and best way to convert Markdown files, and it is FREE!
