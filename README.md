# Modern5E Ruleset

D20 Modern tabletop roleplaying game updated for the D&Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules utilizing the Open Game License (OGL) v.1.0a by [Wizards of the Coast](https://company.wizards.com); see [legal.md](https://github.com/Juxtagames/Modern5E/blob/main/legal.md) for license information.

*Modern5E* will utilize material from both the [D20 Modern SRD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D20_Modern) v1.0 and the newly [REmastered Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition SRD](https://ogl-srd5.com) v5.1 to create a uniquely updated modern version of the 5E ruleset. The *Modern5E Ruleset* shall be available FREE as a download for all to utilize in your own projects and publications via the OGL. Physical and premuim PDF copies of the Modern5E Ruleset will also be available to help support the project by offseting the costs of publishing, editing, artwork, materials and assets.

## Future Publications

Aside from additional supplements and campaign publications (see Support Us), eventually *Modern5E Kits* will become available, allowing gamemasters to pull together any combination of distinct, separate features for their particular campaign; be it fantasy races, magic, cybernetics, aliens and more as these plugins become available.

# Downloads

# Work in Progress

The *Work in Progress* or [WIP](https://github.com/Juxtagames/Modern5E/tree/main/WIP) directory contains all the project files currently under development, and for these reasons, all WIP files are written in *Markdown* format (.MD).

### Why Markdown Format?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/). By its very nature, it can easily convert to HTML and many other formats using any number of various Markdown editors and translators. Markdown is often used to format readme files, write books, blogs, and messages, or create rich text using any plain text or Markdown editor.

Markdown files open in any markdown editor and may then be exported to nearly any popular publishing format desired. However, Microsoft Word or any plain text application can also open markdown (.MD) files, though the markdown syntax is visible, as such there will be much more work involved to utilize the material.
